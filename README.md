# Introduction to Complex Systems Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects developed as part of the course *Introduction to Complex Systems* at Utrecht University. These projects explore fundamental concepts in complex systems through theoretical and computational approaches, including:

## Projects

1. **Spontaneous Synchronization: The Kuramoto Model**  
   - Simulation and analysis of synchronization phenomena in coupled oscillators.  
   - Investigates the coherence parameter and its dependence on coupling strength and initial conditions.

2. **Real Networks**  
   - Study and visualization of real-world networks, analyzing properties such as degree distributions, clustering coefficients, and path lengths.

3. **Cellular Automata**  
   - Implementation of cellular automata to explore emergent behaviors from simple rules, including patterns and self-organization.

## Features
- Fully documented Python implementations.
- Visualizations and results showcasing key findings.
- Designed to be accessible for learners and researchers interested in complex systems.
